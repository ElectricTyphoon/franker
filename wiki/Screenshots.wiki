Selected text (by user) was split to sentences, each sentence then was translated separately and translation was injected.

Only first sentence was selected in the first paragraph; part of a sentence was selected in second sentence; big block of text was selected at the end.

All the text at a page will be like last part of the screenshot above if you just "Frankate Page" without custom selection. Basically, Franker just inlines [http://translate.google.com/ GoogleTranslate]'s bubbles.
