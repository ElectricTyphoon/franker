1.0.0 (2010-08-11)
- Fixed algorithm of next sentence selection.
  It jumps over newly inserted translation block correctly so it is indifferent to the text in the translation block (sometimes translation receives extra dots in its body and that confused Franker before, like at http://www.lenta.ru/news/2010/07/16/passed/).
- Other general improvements in select-next-sentence+inject-translation code
- Refactorings: Franker javascript core extracted into separate file to be shared with Franker for iPhone
- New icon (similar to Franker for iPhone one)
- No more 'Frankate Page' command, since it is cumbersome to support this side feature
- 'Frankate' toolbar button now does 'frankate selection' instead of 'frankate page'

0.9.0 (2010-07-03)
- First usable release, still lacks some features hence not 1.0 version.
- Listed in the official Safari extensions list: http://extensions.apple.com
