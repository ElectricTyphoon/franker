Selected text (by user) was split to sentences, each sentence then was translated separately and translation was injected.<br>
<br>
Only first sentence was selected in the first paragraph; part of a sentence was selected in the second paragraph; big block of text was selected at the end.<br>
<br>
All the text at a page will be like last part of the screenshot above if you just "Frankate Page" without custom selection. Basically, Franker just inlines <a href='http://translate.google.com/'>GoogleTranslate</a>'s bubbles.<br>
